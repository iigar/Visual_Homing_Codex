# Decisions

## 2026-05-22 - Keep Baseline Separate From New Core

Decision:
- Preserve the existing project under `reference/`.
- Build the new flight-critical implementation under `core/`.

Why:
- The inherited implementation contains useful documentation, UI, diagnostics, and prototype logic.
- Its realtime architecture is not suitable as the foundation for a deterministic long-range GPS-denied return core.
- A separate core keeps future flight-critical changes reviewable and prevents accidental coupling to prototype assumptions.

Impact:
- The repository is larger because it includes the full reference tree.
- Future development can extract ideas from the reference implementation without modifying it directly.

Risk:
- Developers may accidentally treat `reference/` as active production code. Documentation should keep reinforcing that it is a baseline/reference area.

## 2026-05-22 - Use Replay-First C++ Core

Decision:
- Build the new core around replayable frame inputs before hardware camera integration.

Why:
- Flight behavior must be testable without risking hardware on every change.
- Replay makes route matching, preprocessing, timing, and failure handling easier to debug.
- Pi Zero 2W constraints require deterministic CPU and memory behavior from the beginning.

Impact:
- Early milestones focus on data formats, frame preprocessing, matching, and timing rather than immediate real camera control.

Risk:
- Replay data can hide hardware-specific latency or exposure problems. Hardware capture remains a separate milestone.
