# Project Memory

## Stable Context

- Project goal: build an independent StabX-like coarse GPS-denied visual return system.
- Target hardware: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W class companion computer, Pi Camera or thermal camera, Matek H743 Slim V3 / ArduPilot flight controller.
- Repository strategy: keep the imported baseline under `reference/` and build the new flight-critical system under `core/`.
- Core implementation direction: C++ replay-first architecture with deterministic timing, bounded queues, and explicit health/failsafe state.
- Current validated core baseline: replay pipeline plus route signature v1 and initial matching has `ReplayFrameSource`, `Gray8ResizePreprocessor`, `HealthMonitor`, `PipelineHarness`, binary `VHRS` route signature writer/reader, `RouteSignatureRecorder`, `Gray8RouteMatcher`, replay-to-route matching CLI, MSVC/CMake build support, and 7 passing CTest tests.
- Near-term priority in Milestone 3: add broader synthetic perturbation coverage and begin direction-error estimation beyond route progress/confidence.
- Python/reference code is useful for documentation, tools, diagnostics, UI concepts, and comparison, but should not become the new flight-critical scheduler.
- Commit messages should be detailed and explain what changed, why, impact, validation, and risk.

## Working Rules

- Technical decisions go to `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
- Current progress goes to `docs/SESSION_LOG.md`.
- Stable project context goes to this file.
- Ideas and research notes go to `notes/`.
- Code changes are captured in detailed git commits.
- Generated build artifacts should stay out of git; prefer reproducible scripts/docs for local validation.
